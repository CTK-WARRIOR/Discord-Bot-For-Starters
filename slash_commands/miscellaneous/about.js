PingPongBot is been used by **${client.users.cache.size}** users and keeps Growing, As of 2021 discord has announced alot of new features for bot and bot developers, its hard for some developer to move there bot to new discord updates, DevMirza is putting his hard work to update the bot to latest features like slash commands, buttons etc,. My main goal is to provide slash commands as well as prefix commands too and added a deploy command which allow a discord server owner to deploy slash commands for there guild as they want and its all non-mandatory totally depends on server owner if they want slash command in there guild. With all that prefix commands are still available until we completely move to slash commands. Till then please keep suppporting the Bot it mesans alot.`)
